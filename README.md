# Sharing Stories 1977 Backend

This repository contains the code for a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) based backend for the [Sharing Stories from 1977: The National Womenâ€™s Conference as a Window into Recent American History](https://drc.lib.uh.edu/current-and-past-projects/young-zarnow/). We use a PostgreSQL as our data store.
